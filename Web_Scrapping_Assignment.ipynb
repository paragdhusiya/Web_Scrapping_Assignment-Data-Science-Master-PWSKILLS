    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python, and it is commonly used for building web applications and APIs. In the context of a web scraping project, Flask might be used for various reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Interface for Users: Flask allows you to create a simple web interface through which users can interact with your web scraping tool. Users can input parameters, initiate the scraping process, and view the results through a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Endpoints: Flask makes it easy to create RESTful API endpoints. If your web scraping project involves serving data to other applications or users programmatically, Flask can provide a convenient way to expose these data endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous Processing: Web scraping can sometimes be time-consuming, especially when scraping a large number of pages. Flask can be combined with asynchronous processing libraries (like Celery) to handle scraping tasks efficiently in the background without blocking the main application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with Databases: If your scraping project involves storing data in a database, Flask can be used to set up endpoints for storing and retrieving data. It provides a convenient way to integrate your scraping tool with a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization and Extensibility: Flask is lightweight and modular, allowing you to customize your application based on the specific needs of your web scraping project. You can easily add middleware, templates, and other extensions to enhance functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Use: Flask is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It provides a straightforward way to set up a web server without a lot of boilerplate code, making it a good choice for small to medium-sized web scraping projects.\n",
